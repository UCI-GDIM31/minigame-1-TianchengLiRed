## Devlog
This is a broken island made of dirt and filled with treasures hidden by the rich. You need to use the WASD and SPACE to control your thief's movement on the island and collect as many gold coins as possible. However, be careful to avoid the rich man's traps:spikes. They will kill you. Also, be careful not to slip and fall from the sky!
